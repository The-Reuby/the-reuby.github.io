When she’s not investigating crimes, Hannah enjoys being in creative and journalistic environments. The Reuby offered the perfect opportunity to engage in a publication exploring the unique intersection of niche news, art, culture, and technology stories. Hannah probably will not leave her life of crime behind, but The Reuby makes a convincing argument for returning to journalism."

She has really enjoyed working with the team and writers this year and looks forward to reading future editions!"
